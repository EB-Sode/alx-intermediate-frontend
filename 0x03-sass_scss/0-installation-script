Objective: install and set up SASS


Inside the alx-intermediate-frontend repository, I create a new directory called 0x03-sass_scss

In my Mac terminal I installed  node version 20.16 as follows:
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
Exit the terminal using the exit command then reopen it.
I also installed node version 22.14.0 as follows:
nvm install 22.14.0

I Installed SASS by using the following command if you have node installed:
npm install sass -v 3.7.4
It didnt want so I used this:
npm install sass@3.7.4 --save-dev(Keeping it in my current directory)
